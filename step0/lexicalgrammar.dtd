     dict has the constant value MW as its text.
     dictref contains the value of the <L> element for MW; this
       is a number, possibly with a decimal point: xxxxxxx.xx
     dictkey element has the dictionary key1. dictkey is deriveable
          from dictkey2, but the algorithm is complicated.
     dictkey2 has the 'expanded' key2 from dictionary in
          a CDATA structure. This is so the xml structures that
          may appear do not need to be specified in this DTD.
     dictlex element uses a CDATA structure to
      contain the lexical information from the dictionary. This is
      so that the xml structures that may appear do not need to be
      specified in this DTD.
     stem has default value equal to the value of 'dictkey'
     inflectid, if present, indicates that key1(2) is an inflected item.
      It's value is the Scharf-style (e.g., m1d)  inflection type of key1.
     loan, if present, indicates the word is a loan word and is
          indeclineable in Sanskrit.
    All the preceding data (dict - stem, and optionally, loan) are
      filled in by the program mwupdate/filter/lexicalgrammar.pl on
      the U. of Cologne server.
