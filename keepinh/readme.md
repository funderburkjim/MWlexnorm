The programs here are variations of those in step0 and step1.
Currently, the output is not part of the repository.
To regenerate the output (lexnorm_keepinh.txt):
sh redo_all.sh.

This script generates lexicalgrammar_keepinh.xml; the only difference
is that the 'type="inh"' records are kept, rather than discarded.
Then lexnorm_keepinh.txt summarizes the material in this xml file.
