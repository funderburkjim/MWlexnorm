The MWlexnorm repository provides material for generation of declensions
for the nominal forms implied by the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary
of 1899.  It is based on the digital edition of this dictionary available at
the [Cologne Sanskrit Lexicon website](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/).

This work was begun approximately 2008 by Jim Funderburk, Malcolm Hyman, and
Peter Scharf. The current form of the work as represented in this repository
is due to Funderburk.

### Statement of the problem

Consider a particular example, the word *guru*.  

Here is how the underlying printed edition looks for the first part of the entry for *guru*:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/10209289/d49cc7e4-67a7-11e5-8146-a23a8aa5c3b4.png)

Here is a link to a display of [guru](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=guru) from the Cologne digital
edition.

For our purposes here, we are interested in only a small part of the 
information about this word available in the dictionary:

गुरु mf(वी)n. 

This tells us that guru is a Sanskrit word with inflected forms in each of
the three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter).

When we look at part of the underlying xml structure of the digitization upon
which the display is based, we see the following arcane structure:
```
<H1><h><hc3>110</hc3><key1>guru</key1><hc1>1</hc1><key2>gur/u</key2></h><body>
 <lex>mf<p><s>vI</s></p>n.</lex> 
```

From a small familiarity with Sanskrit grammar,  we can infer three
pieces of information regarding the declension of *guru*:
* *guru* can be declined as a masculine noun ending in *u*, similar to 
   a model such as *taru* (tree, Deshpande, p. 79)
   guruH, gurU, guravaH  being the nominative case forms in the singular,
   dual, and plural numbers, respectively
   * NOTE 1: These words are spelled using the SLP1 transliteration of Sanskrit.
   * Note 2: Madhav M. Deshpande, A Sanskrit Primer, 2003.
   * Note 3: We can think of *guru* as the *stem* and *m_u* as the model.
* *guru* can be declined as a neuter noun ending in *u*, based on a model
   such as *maDu* (honey, Deshpande, p. 113)
   * Note: We can think of *guru* as the *stem* and *n_u* as the model.
* *guru* can be declined as a feminine noun. However, instead of being
  declined like a feminine noun ending in *u*, such as *Denu* (cow, Deshpande, p. 80), it is declined like a feminine noun ending in long i (I), such as
  *nadI* (river, Deshpande, p. 73).
  * Note: We can think of *gurvI* as the stem, and *f_I* as the model.

From this example of गुरु mf(वी)n, we have inferred, in a systematic way,
the stem and model according to which the declensions of this word may be
computed.   

The purpose of this repository is to write computer programs that carry
forth this systematic process of deriving stem and model for all the
nominal (and indeclineable) forms in the Monier Williams dictionary.

### Summary of the general method

We have divided this stem-model derivation process into three steps; each
of the steps is carried out by programs in the three subdirectories
step0, step1a, step1b.

#### step0:  lexicalgrammar.xml

  This step identifies each record in mw.xml whose markup has information in
  the `<lex>` tag, and summarizes this information in a structured form within
  the lexicalgrammar.xml file.  For our example of *guru*, this information
  looks like:
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0065987.00</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[guru/]]></dictkey2>
<dictkey>guru</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[<lex>mf<p><s>vI</s></p>n.</lex>]]></dictlex>
<stem>guru</stem></gram>
```
  Most of the records are like this; but for a few subcategories, we have
  added  information to that which appears in the dictionary.  Here are examples.
  * pronouns. Example ayam (this)
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0014749.00</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[aya/m]]></dictkey2>
<dictkey>ayam</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[]]></dictlex><stem>idam</stem><lexid>pron</lexid>
</gram>
```
  * cardinal numbers. Example azwan (eight)
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0020173.00</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[azwan]]></dictkey2><dictkey>azwan</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[]]></dictlex><stem>azwan</stem><lexid>card</lexid></gram>
```
  * dual or plural forms (here the MW headword is a dual or plural form).
    Example Aditya-candrO (sun and moon)
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0023917.00</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[Aditya/--candrO]]></dictkey2><dictkey>AdityacandrO</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[<lex>m. <ab>du.</ab></lex>]]></dictlex>
<stem>Adityacandra</stem><inflectid>m1d</inflectid></gram>
```
  * present active participle. Example arcat (shining, praising)
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0015704.00</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[arcat]]></dictkey2><dictkey>arcat</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[<lex>mfn.</lex>]]></dictlex>
<stem>arcat</stem><lexid>prap</lexid><rootclass>arc-1</rootclass>
</gram>
```

  * future active participle. Example akarizyat (not intending to do)
```
<gram><dict>MW</dict><dictref>0000171.10</dictref>
<dictkey2><![CDATA[a-karizyat]]></dictkey2><dictkey>akarizyat</dictkey>
<dictlex><![CDATA[<lex>mfn.</lex>]]></dictlex>
<stem>a-karizyat</stem><lexid>fap</lexid><rootclass>kf</rootclass>
</gram>
```

#### step1a: lexnorm.txt and lexnorm-other.txt

This step normalizes the information of the lexicalgrammar.xml file. 
Basically, the information of the lexicalgrammar.xml file is complicated to
parse. So a simpler, more uniform representation is desireable for further
computation.  

For our *guru* example, here is the simplification present in lexnorm.txt:
```
65987	guru	guru/	m:f#vI:n
```

We present the record number (65987), the headword (guru), the extended
headword (guru/, this is the dictkey2 field of lexicagrammar.xml), and a simplified
version of the dictlex field (m:f#vI:n).

For the special categories (pronouns, cardinals, dual-plurals, present and
future participles), the simplified records are written to the lexnorm-other.txt
file.
For examples:
```
14749	ayam	aya/m	LEXID=pron,STEM=idam
20173	azwan	azwan	LEXID=card,STEM=azwan
15704	arcat	arcat	LEXID=prap,STEM=arcat,ROOTCLASS=arc-1
171.1	akarizyat	a-karizyat	LEXID=fap,STEM=a-karizyat,ROOTCLASS=kf
```

#### step1b. stemmodel.txt, etc.

As mentioned in the *guru* example, step1b carries out the specification
of *stem* and *model*.  

The results are in the stemmodel.txt file for most cases. For cases of
pronouns, etc., the results are in the stemmodel_other.txt file.  The
stemmodel_log.txt file has a couple of instances where we aren't sure what
the specification should be.

Here is how our *guru* record appears in stemmodel.txt:
```
MW-0065987.00	guru	<f>guru m_u</f><f>gurvI f_I</f><f>guru n_u</f>
```

The third field contains the stem and model information present in this
record.   

Note that we have computed the implied stem *gurvI* for the feminine form, 
based on the 'f#vI' information of lexnorm.txt.  

There are many other similar subtleties involved in the transition from
lexnorm.txt to stemmodel.txt.  Here are a few other examples, where we
show the lexnorm.txt information and the corresponding stemmodel.txt data.
```
32	aMSahArin	a/MSa--hArin	m:f:n
MW-0000032.00	aMSahArin	<f>aMSa-hArin m_in</f><f>aMSa-hAriRI f_I</f><f>aMSa-hArin n_in</f>

45	aMSin	aMSin	m:f:n
MW-0000045.00	aMSin	<f>aMSin m_in</f><f>aMSinI f_I</f><f>aMSin n_in</f>

An n->R sandhi routine applies to the last pada (as determined by key2) to
decided whether the feminine stem for a noun ending in 'in' should end in
'RI' or 'nI'.

27	aMSaBUta	a/MSa--BUta	m:f:n
MW-0000027.00	aMSaBUta	<f>aMSa-BUta m_a</f><f>aMSa-BUtA f_A</f><f>aMSa-BUta n_a</f>
For the very common case of a headword ending in short 'a' and with the 'mfn'
lexical information (typically, an adjective), the feminine stem is computed
by replacing the final 'a' by 'A', with model such as *latA*.

65	aMSumat	aMSu/--ma/t	m:f:n
MW-0000065.00	aMSumat	<f>aMSu-mat m_mat</f><f>aMSu-matI f_I</f><f>aMSu-mat n_mat</f>

We assign the model 'm_mat', in the belief that a special declension model
is applicable.  We also compute the feminine stem to end in 'matI'.

103832	namat	namat	m:f#ntI:n
MW-0103832.00	namat	<f>namat m_mat</f><f>namantI f_I</f><f>namat n_mat</f>

Here the feminine stem ends in 'antI', based on the information 'f#ntI' 
provided by the MW dictionary for namat.

The reason for preserving the last pada designation, as implied by MW key2,
also has to do with n->R sandhi that will occur in the process of declension.
(I am thinking of cases like 3s of rAma, which is rAmeRa rather than rAmena
due to n->R sandhi.)  For instance consider trayImaya:
MW-0087487.00	trayImaya	<f>trayI-maya m_a</f><f>trayI-mayI f_I</f><f>trayI-maya n_a</f>

The 3s of trayImaya would be trayImayeRa if 'trayI' and 'maya' are considered
in the same pada; but would be trayI-mayena if the 'r' of 'trayI' is in a 
different pada, as MW information provides.

```

#### current limitations of the 'model'

In terms of number of headwords involved,  the model designations in 
stemmodel.txt provide an adequate basis for declension generation. 
This is because most nominals have a stem
ending in a vowel and have declined forms following a simple model based
on the ending vowel (along with the gender).

However, there are significant numbers of important, frequently used 
nominals that end in a consonant. For these consonant ending nominals, the
current model designations in stemmodel.txt must be viewed with scepticism
until the associated declension algorithms have been implemented.

A further caveat is in order regarding nominals whose declensions are 
typically regarded as 'irregular'.   Two examples that come to mind are
*strI* (woman) and its compounds, and *DI* (thought) and its compounds.
Currently, these appear in stemmodel.txt with the model 'f_I':
```
MW-0101266.00	DI	<f>DI f_I</f>
MW-0254928.00	strI	<f>strI f_I</f>
```
which implies that they are declined like *nadI*.  However, this is wrong.

The identification of these irregular cases remains to be done, along with
a systematic means of specifying their models so that an ensuing 
declension engine will know how to recognizing these cases as ones
requiring special handling.
